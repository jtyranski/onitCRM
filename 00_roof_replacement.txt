See the attachment for a mockup example

1. In customer portal:
• in View mode, Roof Replacment tab will only show if there are any proposals created.
• In Edit mode (shown), user can see the Roof Replacement tab, and create/edit/delete proposals.
• columns to show should be: Created (date), Proposal ID, Description, Replacement Cost, then in edit mode (Edit, Delete, Get Done) and view mode (View)
2. When user creates a proposal:
• List sections to include in this proposal, user selects with checkboxes.
• have text box for creating a proposal ID (this should be unique, so it should check if it's been used before), and if a user enters a number, then the NEXT proposal that gets generated it 
should look at the last proposal ID number and add a 1 to it.
• text area where user can cut and paste the replacement scope of work.  You will need to escape any special characters.
• Replacement Value (user may or may not have commas or decimals.  If no decimals or if .00 don't shown the decimals.
• Checkbox for 'Include Report', if selected, will also include the inspection report with only the sections selected (no budget matrix as last page).
• Checkbox for 'Include repair options', if selected will also include an unsigned repair proposal for all uncompleted deficiencies.
• If user adds additional literature, then that will also be included (have delete link to remove any additional literature).
3. Once user submits, it will then go to view mode with a 'View' link and will show the roof replacement tab.
4. When viewing, this will be a link to the PDF that was created.  The order of all included options when creating:
• Inspection report (of only selected sections)
• Replacement proposal (scope of work and signature page)

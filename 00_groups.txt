Customers who have bought an enterprise product, need to be able to manage multiple offices without those offices seeing each others data.

Users in a group (or sub-group) will only be able to see other users and properties within that group (or sub-group), when sending emails, creating activities, viewing calendars, filtering opportunities.

Users in a group (or sub-group) will only be able to see and work with properties assigned to a their group (or sub-group).  If a company (menards for example), has two properties in two different groups, 
that company will be shared by both groups, but only the properties in that group will be shown.

The attached PDF shows how groups and sub-groups will work:
page 1 - Illustrates how the Enterprise Core model works
• In Tools, Add a checkbox for 'Enterprise Core'
• In the Admin tool, add 'Manage Groups'

page 2 - There are groups and subgroups.
• Groups can be added or removed. Whichever group is selected, you can edit the name to the right and which core users are a part of that group.
• When a group is selected, the sub-group box will update to reflect what sub-groups are created.  To the right of sub-groups, can change the name of the selected sub-group.
• If a group (or sub-group) is selected and removed clicked, if there are any users assigned to that group (or sub-group), warn the user with a pop-up that there are still users (or properties) 
assigned to those groups and continuing will remove them.

page 3 - just illustrates whichever group is selected, will update the other boxes for editing group members and sub-groups.

page 4 - When editing users profiles
• you can also select what groups they belong to.
• Only groups that have sub-groups will appear in the dropdown for sub-groups.
• If nobody is selected in any groups (or sub-groups), it is assumed they have access to the main core and they are not filtered.

page 5 - Assigning properties to groups
Under a property, there will be a new tab called 'Groups' which will allow a user to edit which group and sub-group it will show up in.
